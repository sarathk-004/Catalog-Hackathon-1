## E-Waste Management

### Task
> The government and private organizations always require electronic items which may need to be 
replaced periodically to benefit from the newly developed electronic gadgets/advanced features. 
Hence, there is a need to provide a software platform to collect, monitor and 
recycle E-waste.

### Overview
The E-Waste Monitoring System is a console-based application designed to manage and monitor 
electronic waste (e-waste). This system helps track the status of various electronic devices, 
categorizing them into collection, required, and recycling queues. The system generates reports 
to provide insights into the current state of e-waste items.
